            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is therefore well observed by Divines, that the three Books of St. <hi>John</hi> have speciall reference to the three Theologicall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity. His Gospel hath reference to Faith; there he makes a description of Christ in his Merits &amp; Mercies, and would engraft us into him by a lively Faith. 2 His Epistles to Charitie; there he makes a description of Love, and would unite our hearts in the bond of Peace and Amitie. And then 3. His Book of Revelation hath reference to Hope; there he makes a description of Heaven, and would encourage us against fear of death, by the consideration of that blessed Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of eternall Rest, to be celebrated by all the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the faith of Christ: So saith the Text, <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>First by way of Explication, to shew what it is to die in the Lord. That implies two things especially. 1. To die in the Lord is to die for the confession of the Faith. 2. To die in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206882:4"/> of the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>First, to die for the confession of the faith; so <hi>Beza</hi> reads the words. <hi>Blessed are they who die for the Lord,</hi> who sacrifice their lives for Christs sake, and the Gospells sake, who suffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome either Passively in act only, as the Innocents at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> or Actively in act and will also, as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> and the rest of the faithfull witnesses of Christ, in all ages.</p>
            <p>These indeed are blessed in their Works, and blessed in their Reward: In their Work, because they suffer as Christ, and for Christ; as Christ, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>I rejoice in my sufferings for you;</hi>

            <p>But then, as they suffer as Christ, so for Christ, for thy sake we are killed all the day long:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.36.</note> in the Primitive times Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were wont to call Martyrdome by the name of <hi>Corona Martyrii,</hi> the Crown of Martyrdome, because this was the crown, and complement, and perfection of a mans happinesse upon earth, to suffer for Christ, and to Seale his Profession with his dearest blood. Heathens accounted it their greatest honour to die for their Countrie, Christ thought it an honour to die for sinners, the just for the unjust, how much more should sinners esteeme it honourable to die for their Saviour, the unjust for the just, that's the best peice of service we can doe him, and such a high degree of promotion, as the highest Angel in Heaven is not permitted to arrive at.</p>

            <p>Thus they are blessed in their Work: And 2. they are blessed in their Reward. They that suffer with Christ in the Vale of Teares, shall reigne with Christ in the Kingdome of Glorie: They that have the marks of the Lord Jesus upon their Bodies, shall have the crowne of Life upon their Heads. They that goe to Mount <hi>Calvarie</hi> with Christ, and for Christ, in this world, shall go to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with Christ, to triumph in the world to come. Who are they that are welcom to the spirituall <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they that are forced thorough the red Sea of their own Blood? Who are they that are carried in white Robes,<note place="margin">Rev. 7.9.14.</note> with Palmes in their hands, but they that come out of great Tribulation for the name of the Lord Jesus? If a <hi>Julian</hi> will honour the memorie of those that were slaine in his warres; how much more will Jesus reward all his faithfull witnesses, that have lost their lives, that have been prodigall of their blood in this quarrell, and for his sake? <hi>Right deare in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints. Psal.</hi> 115.16.</p>
            <p>In the second place, To die in the Lord is to die in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith of Christ, in the state of Grace, and eternall Salvation. And this is considerable in three particulars:

                  <item>1. To die in the Favour of God.</item>
                  <item>2. In the Faith of Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. In the Peace of a good Conscience.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, To die blessedly, is to die in the favour of God; so <hi>Moses</hi> died: according to the Word of the Lord. The <hi>Caldees</hi> Paraphrase is,<note place="margin">Deut. 3 4.5</note>
               <hi>Hee died with a kiss from the mouth of God.</hi> God is pleased sometimes to kisse the righteous in their death, to smile upon them on their Death-beds, to embrace them in the armes of his Love, to present them with a bunch of Grapes before they come at <hi>Canaanâª</hi> giving them some speciall tokens of his Favour, as a Pawn and Pledge of that Glorie which is to be revealed in Heaven. And surely they die most comfortably who have the strongest assurance of the love of God in their hearts: A man may leave <hi>Egypt</hi> with joy, when he hath a Land of Promise before him; he may well part with an earthly Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, when he hath Writings sealed for an Immortall Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he may goe to his owne house of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. To <hi>die in the Lord</hi> is to die in the faith of Christ, and that is first to confesse the name of Christ, because there is no <hi>Salvation but in his name;</hi> Act 4.12. all sufficiency in his name, insuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. It is to professe the truth of Christ, because a man cannot be saved in any Religion: there is but <hi>one Truth, one Faith, one Baptisme, one Mediator.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.5.</note>

            <p n="3">3. It is to apply the merit of Christ, because Christ in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall notion will never bring a man to heaven. It is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be a Christian in name, or a Protestant in Profession, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be a reall and living member of Christ, by a faith of application as well as apprehension. <hi>They die in the Lord</hi> who are united to Christ, and engrafted into his body, by a lively faith in his blood. There are many that leave the doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Christ hovering in the air, they take up in a historicall commemoration of his Passion, in a knowledge swimming in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

The Angells ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was driven home by way of application, <hi>unto you is borne a Saviour.</hi> It is not the report of a Saviour, but the embrace,<note place="margin">Luke 2.11.</note> and application of a Saviour, that renders a man Truly happy. <hi>M.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206882:6"/> the staires, in the wounds of Christ, in the heart of Christ: As Queen <hi>Mary</hi> said, <hi>if she was opened, one might see the Towne of</hi> Callis <hi>lie at her heart.</hi> As Christ lies at the heart of a Beleever by love, so a Beleever lies at the heart of Christ by faith; so that it is not <hi>Christ dying at Jerusalem,</hi> but <hi>Christ living in the heart,</hi> that must save us: Not <hi>Christ hanging on the Crosse,</hi> but <hi>Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe;</hi> we must with <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> take him downe from the Crosse, wrap him in clean linnen, lay him in a new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, a holy, heavenly, penitent, believing heart, then he is ours indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thrasyllus</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> being distracted in his brain, had a strong conceit, that all the Ships and their lading in the Port of <hi>Pyrea</hi> were his owne: It is not Fancy, but Faith which assures a Christian all the Merchandise of Heaven, all the ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Primitive Christians died blessedly, they died in Faith, not in a generall Belief of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>

            <p>Thus old <hi>Simeon</hi> died Blessedly, because he died Believingly, with Heaven in his Eye,<note place="margin">Luke 2.29, 30.</note> and Christ in his Armes, <hi>Lord let thy Servant depart in peace.</hi> That man is most sure to die in peace, whose eyes have seen the salvation of God, who hath the spirit of Christ in his heart, as <hi>Simeon</hi> had the body of Christ in his armes, who hath made his Calling and Election sure, and knowes for certaine that Christ hath shed his Blood for his Redemption in particular, according to that rare and ravishing expression, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Christ loved me, and gave himself for me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And lastly, To die in the Lord, is to die in the peace of a good Conscience. A conscientious man dies blessedly, howsoever, or whensoever, or wheresoever he dies; therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had received the summons of Death, he fled to the Castle of his good Conscience;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> died in the Lord, when his heart bare witnesse of his integrity, insomuch, as he makes a glorious Manifesto, and Challenge to all the World. My departure is at hand, and who can accuse me of Deceit, or Briberie, or Oppression? <hi>Whose Ox have I taken? Or whose Asse,</hi> &amp;c. Thus they that live the Life of the Righteous, shall die the Death of the Righteous: They shall be welcome to Gods Hive in Heaven, who come la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with works of Piety and Charity from the field of the World. If the wise Virgins keep Oyle in their Lamps, and Oyl in their Vessels, Faith, and a good Conscience in the course of their lives, they shall attend the Bridegroom Jesus Christ, to sing the Marriage Song in Heaven, the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Song the Lamb.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, I may very fitly apply that passage of <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jehonadab, Is thy heart right as mine is? if it be,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 10.15</note>

Are they holy, humble, honest hearts, hating Sinne, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Righteousnesse? Now, if you can make <hi>Jehonadabs</hi> answer, and say, they are right (Lord) in some measure, <hi>we believe, Lord help our Æ²nbelief;</hi> we are sorry for Sinne, <hi>Lord increase our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> We trust he have a good conscience, at least we desire to have one; then <hi>give me thy hand</hi> (sayes God) <hi>and come into my Chariot, He grace thee with my Favour in this World, and crowne thee with my Presence, my Glory, in the World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much by way of Explication. I proceed to the proof and confirmation of the Point, as it was laid down in the Text. First by way of Testimony; <hi>I heard a voice from Heaven, saying, write;</hi> and so saith the Spirit, <hi>that they rest,</hi> &amp;c. Here (with <hi>Jonathan</hi>) we may taste of the Hony as it drops by the way, and observe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206882:7"/> That it is the duty of all men to believe in heart, and to preserve in memory whatsoever is delivered from Heaven.</p>
            <p>To believe in heart, because the Voice from Heaven confirmes it; in every Chapter we heare read, there is a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in every Sermon we heare preacht, which is consonant to the Doctrine of Scripture, there is a Voice from Heaven. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is not the Word and Work of Man, but the blessed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>sus Christ, that noble Instrument which he hath chiefly appointed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> and sanctified for the salvation of Sinners. It is God the Father that invites you to Repentance, it is Christ that stands at your doore and knocks, and wooes for Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is the holy Spirit that strives with you, as in the daies of <hi>Noah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> take heed you resist not the strivings of the Spirit, lest the Lord deliver you up to the rage of Satan, and to the rebellion of your own heart; take heed you shut not your eyes when Christ is in your company, that you do not stop your cares when the Voyce calls from Heaven, when the Spirit saith Write; make not the Ministers of the Gospel so unhappy, as to rise up in Judgement against you; do not give them occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, as the Prophet of old, <hi>Who hath believed our Report?</hi> &amp;c. We preach Repentance,<note place="margin">Esay 53.1.</note> and amendment of Life; we preach Christ, and him crucified; we preach comfort to the Penitent, and terror to the Obstinate; But who believes our report? We have piped to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned, and ye have not wept; we would allure you with the sweets of the Gospel, or else terrifie you with the threats of the Law; but yet we may complaine, Who hath beleived our Report? It is our Report, but it is Gods Message; we are Ambassadours of Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> we pray you in his stead to be reconciled, to seale the League, and compose the great D fference; we are Spokesmen for Christ (to speak it with reverence) we beseech you in His name, and for His sake, to accept of the match, to untwist the contract with Sinne and Satan, and to enter into a matrimoniall Covenant with Jesus Christ; and if you believe not us, believe him that sent us; we speak not in our owne name, the Voice from Heaven saith, Write; and write this as an unquestionable Truth, That they are blessed which die in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learn from hence, to keep in memory what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206882:7"/> from Heaven, because the Spirit commands it; the Spirit saith, Write. The sinnes of <hi>Judah</hi> are written with a pen of Iron, and the point of a Diamond. As our Teares are bottled, and our Prayers recorded in Heaven, so our Sinnes are registred there, and put in a book of Remembrance, till they are blotted out, and washed away in the blood of Jesus Christ. The Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall be written in tables of Stone, that we may write them in the tables of our Hearts.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.8.12.1</note> Christ saith to the Angels of the Churches, <hi>write;</hi> to <hi>Smyrna, write;</hi> and to <hi>Pergamus, write;</hi> and to <hi>Thyatyra, write still.</hi> According to this <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> in the Text, <hi>write.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Writing is one of the chiefest instruments of humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the safest way to convey the blessings of God to posterity. <hi>Vox audita perit, litera scripta manet.</hi> The word in the Eare vanishes, but writ in the Book, remains by us to do us good hereafter.</p>
            <p>It is lawfull and commendable then, both for Preacher and Hearer, to write what is delivered: For the Preachers, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit saith to the Angels of the Churches, <hi>write,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">

            <p>Thus the Scripture mentions a Writing, which <hi>Elijah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sent to <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.12, 13. But how by <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he was translated before,<note place="margin">2 Kings 3.</note> and <hi>Elisha</hi> prophesied in his stead before this time in the daies of <hi>Jehosaphat?</hi> Some of the Jewish Rabbins have a groundlesse conceit, that <hi>Elijah</hi> sent the Writing from Heaven; more probable it is, that he left the Prophesie behinde him: but yet more probable,<note place="margin">2 Kings 2</note> that by <hi>Elijah</hi> is here meant <hi>Elisha,</hi> who might be called <hi>Elijah,</hi> because he had received a double portion of his spirit according to his request.</p>
            <p>He sent the writing to <hi>Jehoram,</hi> some think out of feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he durst not reprove him to his face. Others, to declare the certainty of infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First, <hi>They rest,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>and are become a burden too heavy for me to beareâª</hi> So heavy is this burden, as the Scripture tells us, <hi>Help was laid upon one that was mighty:</hi> God sent his owne Sonne to beare the burden of our Transgressions, and this caused him to sweat, and groan, and bleed, and cry out to the amazement of Men and Angels, <hi>My God, my God, Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great is labour of sinne, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> cries out (as an undone man) for freedome from it. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note>
               <hi>Who shall deliver me?</hi> &amp;c When shall I have freedome from this wofull thraldome? Not on this side of the Grave.</p>
            <p>Here the Saints are cloathed with infirmities, and infirmities in those things wherein they are most eminent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> is the meekest man in the earth, and yet there was a scar in his curious complexion; He once spake unadvisedly with his lipps. <hi>Job</hi> a mirrour of Patience, yet put him into the balance of the Sanctuary, and he wants more than the graines of allowance; he once cursed the day of his Birth. The glory of <hi>Davids</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is eclipsed with a distrustfull feare of man, <hi>I shall one day perish by the hand of</hi> Saul.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 37.1.</note> Thus in this world they are party-coloured, like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lambs; there is some darknesse in their clearest light; some Drosse in their purest Gold, some Blemish in the beauty of all their Graces. When shall they be deliver'd then? The Apostle tells us in the world to come,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.7.</note>
               <hi>He that is dead is freed from sin,</hi> is eased of that burden: When an old House falls flat to the ground, then will the Vermine be gone: so when the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Clay, the old Houses of our Bodies, fall to the ground by Death, then will the Vermine of our corruptions be dispersed and destroyed: Those earthen Vessels that were legally pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, could not be clensed, but by breaking all in pieces: so the best of Gods servants, whom the Scripture calls earthen Vessels, they cannot be sufficiently purged from their sinfull pollutions, till they be broken all in pieces by death. The life to come is the time of their full R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Adam</hi> was happy in Paradise, in a <hi>posse non peccare,</hi> a possibility not to sin: how blessed are the Saints triumphant in the celestiall Paradise, in a <hi>non posse peccare,</hi> being free from all possibility of sinning, and falling away from that incomparable happinesse, which the disobedient Angels lost?</p>
            <p>Againe they rest from the labour of corruption, that is from the sinnes of the World, they are a grievous burden to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. So they were to zealous <hi>Elijah,</hi> the sinnes of the times made him weary of his life; the Pride, and Whoredome, and Idolatry of <hi>Jesabell;</hi> the great neglect of the worship, and contempt of the Prophets of the Lord, went to his heart,<note place="margin">1 King. 19.4.</note> and caused him to wish earnestly for a Rest from that Vexation. <hi>It is enough for me, let me die, for I am not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my Fathers.</hi> So they were to righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> the sinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> were as so many Swords at his Heart,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.7. Verse 8. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now here is the blessednesse of the righteous departed; their conversation is not with Idolatrous <hi>Jesabells,</hi> and unclean <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> but with glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> and glorified <hi>Saints;</hi> they live in a Land where no venomous creature can live; in an Ark, where no unclean Beast can enter; in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above, which is free, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, they that die in the Lord, are blessed, for they rest from the labour of Affliction. I need not tell you the servants of God on earth are subject to Afflictions: Is not the Church in generall compared to the Ark, floating upon the waves of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and persecution? Is it not the little City besi ged? The Bush on a flame? The Lillie among thorns? The little Flock in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206882:9"/> the midst of Wolves? The Woman weeping in the Wildernesse? Need I instance in particular members of the Church, when the Apostle assures us, that all that will live godly must suffer Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, suffer Tribulation in one way or other,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12. Acts 14.22.</note> at one time or other? No Crosse, no Christ; no Crown of Thorns, no Crown of Glory; no Tribulation here, no Glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>livers them, When? <hi>Aut hic, aut hinc,</hi>

            <p>Or what if the righteous, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, can find no ground to set the sole of their foot on, because the waters of afflictions prevaile so much in the world? Yet in the end, Christ Jesus, the spirituall <hi>Noah,</hi> will put forth his hand from the Ark, and take them in, to settle them in everlasting Rest. Indeed, many times it goes very hard with the children of God in this world; <hi>Israel</hi> may make Bricks, when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lie upon their Beds; Christ may be crucified, when <hi>Barabbas</hi> is delivered; <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s head may dance on the Scaffold, when the daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi> is dancing in the Palace; <hi>Lazarus</hi> may be glad of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

He takes measure of the frame of our Spirits, and shapes his temptations accordingly: he had a wedge of Gold for covetous <hi>Achan,</hi> a convenient Vineyard for greedy <hi>Ahab,</hi> a beautifull <hi>Tamar</hi> for lascivious <hi>Ammon.</hi> Well may we pronounce the Saints departed in a blessed and glorious condition, when they are rescued from the paw of the roaring Lyon, when <hi>Lucifer,</hi> is cast downe, never to be entertained againe.

            <p>There is an overflowing Fountain of comfort in that passage of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18,</note> and it springs from the same ground with this in my Text. I reckon, that the Sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereafter.</p>
            <p>I reckon, I have cast up the account,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> and considered seriously of the matter, summed up all the Sufferings that can be endured or imagined, temporall and spirituall, and I finde they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely far short of that rest and recompence of the Saints in Heaven. I have put all the miseries of this life in the balance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206882:15"/> and behold they are nothing no that exceeding weight of glory which shall be revealed in Heaven, they are not worthy to be compared (to be named the same day) with those incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unconceivable comforts laid up for the righteous in the Kingdome of Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And more particularly, the Text speaks comfort against the feare of Death, our owne death: there is naturally in man an unwillngnesse to die, and a feare of death: we would linger in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and live still in <hi>Babylon,</hi> though in a state of Bondage; Grace is ever willing. but Nature is ever fearfull to die: Death is terriblest of all terrible things, according to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopherâª and the King of <hi>Terrors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 18.14.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> expresseth it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best of Gods Servants, <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Davidâª</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and Christ himselfe, as man, declares an unwillingnesse to die, at least a great sadnesse of spirit upon the approaches of death. A word of comfort will be very seasonable in this particular, which I would commend to you under these two notions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Death cannot be an enemy to harm.</p>

               <hi>Death is swallowed up in Victory:</hi> and with the Apostle, <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi>

This brings me to the third and last stream of comfort, against the death &amp; departure of Friends. The time will come that we must part with our <hi>Isaacs,</hi> our <hi>Benjamines,</hi> nearest Friends, and dearest Comforts. Then remember my Text: If they <hi>die in the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:206882:16"/> take no care for them, they are blessed, they are at their rest. <hi>Praemisimus, non amisimus,</hi> They are not lost, but laid up in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: when the Lord returned in mercy to <hi>Job,</hi> and was pleased to set him up the second time, we finde that he doubled all his outward comforts, he gave him as many more Camels and Sheep, and Oxen, as he had before; but he restored onely the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of children to him; as will appeare by comparing the first, and last Chapters of <hi>Job</hi> together, he gave him seven Sonnes, and three daughters. And the reason is rendred by St. <hi>August,</hi> because his Sheep and Oxen were utterly consumed, but his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were in the hand of God; they were at rest, though they suffered a sudden and violent death.</p>

            <p>I come now to the third and last use of Exhortation, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us all to make preparation for death; it is nothing to know the Reward in Heaven, except we doe the work on Earth; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to wish to die the death of the righteous, except we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live the life of the righteous; therefore, that we may be blessed in life and death, that we may live to the Lord, and die in the Lord, give me leave to commend something to your consideration, and something to your care and consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practise. To your consideration:
<list>

                  <item>2. Uncertainty of the time of Death.</item>

                  </gap> 14, 15. Heb. 9 27.</note>Indeed there is a necessity for death, since the fall of man, yet not such a necessity as hath no Law; for there is plaine Statute for it; <hi>Statutum est, &amp;c.</hi> It is appointed to all men once to die.</p>
            <p>Here I must make answer to a double question:
<list>
                  <item>1. Whether the Law of mortality be naturall:</item>
                  <item>2. Whether it be universall or not.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the former, I answer negatively; man was not made mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but made himselfe immortall by his sinne. <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath been condemned by Councells, and therefore I need not stand to confute it, That man died <hi>naturae necessitate, non peccati merito,</hi> by a necessity of Nature, not by a penalty for Sin. This Doctrine would bring the wisdome of God in question, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing a Law of mortality, after he had created man mortall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It would bring the justice of God in question, to punish with death where no offence is committed. Every penalty is for some iniquity:<note place="margin">Omnis poena est propter aliquam culpam. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
               </note> This is therefore the conclusion of all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divines, <hi>Non expoliandus Corpore, sed supervestiendus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalite.</hi> There had bin no separation of the body from the soul by death, had there not been a separation of the soul from God by sinne: a possibility to die, is from Nature, a necessity to die is from Sinne, and an impossibility to die is from Grace, <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the second question, I answer affirmatively. The Law of Mortality is universall. Though the Scripture mentions some that have not died, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> their translation may teach us, that God may make an exception to a generall rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>, he can and will dispense with that Law, whereof himselfe is the sole and mediate Author, as he did with the Morall law, in some cases with the sixth commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> when he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to sacrifice his Son: and with the eighth Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not steale,</hi> when he commanded the <hi>Israelites</hi> to spoyle the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> God is free, and an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Agent; he doth not binde himselfe, when he bindes his people; his Prerogative is above the Law, his Mercy is over all his Works: As the Judge may passe Sentence and yet reprieve
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206882:17"/> the Malefactor, so God may condemne the race and generation of Mankinde to be liable to death, and yet may send his royall Dispensation, his gracious pardon for any one in particular. Who can say unto him, <hi>What doest thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Scripture mention some that shall not die, as they that shall be found alive at the coming of Christ to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in plain termes, <hi>we shall not all sleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.51.</note>
               <hi>but we shall be changed:</hi> The meaning is, they shall not so sleep, as to continue in the state of the dead, but be changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye; yet such a change, as they shall have a dissolution, and in the same moment, a redintegration,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> in Psal. 68.20.</note> a reall Death, and a reall resurrection, though no sleeping in the Grave of Corruption.</p>
            <p>Well then, Let this consideration of certainty of death, sink into your hearts, and take deep impression, and work your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to a holy and heavenly frame. <hi>Plato</hi> once complained of the <hi>Argentines, These men live</hi> (sayes he) <hi>as if they should never die.</hi> Truly many Christians live so vainly, and wantonly, and wickedly, as if they should never die, or be called to account, as if Death were but a Scar-crow, or Bugbeare, a painted Hell.</p>
            <p>You see one Generation passing, and another Generation co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, one Friend and Neighbour drops into the Grave after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and when your turne shall be you know not: This you may be assured of, Death will come certainly, and it may be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, it may be suddainly, <hi>What man is he that liveth and shall not see Death?</hi> Psal. 89.48.</p>
            <p>Then againe, consider the uncertainty of the time of death: The rich man promised himselfe a certainty, sung a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Have you any assurance of the means of grace, or a blessing upon the meanes? God indeed hath promised par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the Penitent; but where hath he promised repentance to the Peccant? Repentance is the gift of God as well as Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and truly there is no certainty of it, it is promised but with a peradventure, if God peradventure, will give them repentance.

               <p>The next particular concernes the Duty she performed. To name but two, Hearing and Praying.</p>
               <p>Hearing, you are witnesses of her constant waiting at Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes gate, and daily attending at the Posts of these Doors, how she wore the Threshold of this Temple with her diligent feet, how she longed, with <hi>David,</hi> to dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of her life, and how sometimes she would hazard the health of her Body, rather than neglect the welfare of her Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>e. And lastly, when by indisposition of health she could not feast with God in his Publique Ordinances; how carefull she was to make use of that Provision which God had sent her at home, by hearing divine instructions, read to her by those that were about her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Praying it was her daily sacrifice, and hourely imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That passage in the Gospel hath often put me in minde of her: there we finde a Prophetesse of the same name,<note place="margin">Luke 2.36, 37.</note>
                  <hi>Anna,</hi> in the same condition, a Widdow, much what of the same age, Fourscore and four yeares, and of the same devotion; she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the Temple, but served God by fasting and prayer, night and day. It is well knowne what a great part of the day this religious Gentlewoman spent in private devotions, during the time of her health; and in her sicknesse, it was her continuall exercise to call upon God for pardoning, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercies, which she cheerefully performed (while she was able) with the outward expression of the voice, and when the naturall strength of the body decayed, she was st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In a word, she delighted to sing <hi>Hosannaes</hi> by prayer on earth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath taken her to sing <hi>Allelujahs</hi> of praise in Heaven.</p>
               <p>So much for the first particular, as she stood in relation to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The blessednesse of her life is considerable, as she stood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the World. Here indeed I might multiply particulars, and begin with her Piety (as Civilians call it) to her children, being religiously carefull to promote their interest, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this world, and that which is to come. Although, through some cross acts of Providence, she was disappointed in her hopes of setling such fortunes upon them as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ght be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:206882:23"/> from such a considerable estate; yet was it her comfort, that she left them a present competency, with hopes of speedy improvement, by the recovery of those debts which she had with much charge and trouble, long contended for; specially her hope was, God had estated her children in Grace given them a portion of spirituall comforts, and therefore would deny them so much of the world, as should make most for his owne glory, and their everlasting happiness, according to our Saviours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we might consider her Hospitality to strangers. Famous she was for good House-keeping, for a free, and generous, and bountifull Entertainment. She was so much given to Hospitality, as she made her owne House a Hospitall: thither came the Lame, and the Blinde, and the Diseased, and that without money, or money-worth, for the cure and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. She was indeed, Eyes to theb linde, and Feet to the lame: She was a Mother to the poore, and the cause she knew not she searched out,<note place="margin">Job 29.15, 16.</note> as that holy Man speaks of himselfe. This brings in her Charity to the Poore: S <hi>Paul</hi> sets downe two characters of the Widdow indeed, both remarkable in her, <hi>To lodge Strangers, and to relieve the Afflictedâª</hi> 1 Tim. 5.10. How many Widdowes have been sustained by her liberality, how many Fatherless children have eaten bread at her Doore, in her House, at her Table, I need not tell you, but appeale to your owne experince. <hi>She heard the cry of the Fatherlesse, and made the Widdowes heart to sing for joy,</hi> Job. 29 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 112.9.</note>K. <hi>James</hi>'s father was called the poor mans King, She might be called the poor mans Widdow, she dispersed abroad, and gave to the poor,<note place="margin">Eccles. 11.1, 2. Luke 12.24.</note> she gave a portion to Seven, and also to Eight, she cast her Bread upon the Waters, and, like the wise Steward in the Gospel, provided portions for the poore in due season.</p>
               <p>What need I mention her veracity, her reall and true affection to her Friends, her affability and bounty to her Servants and Tenants; her respect and reverence to the Clergie, acting <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>'s part, as well as <hi>Marie</hi>'s; not onely feasting her soule upon Christ in his Doctrine, but also feasting Christ in his Members, and Messengers, with a bountifull Hand, and a cheerfull Heart.</p>
               <p>Put all these together, and you will conclude her death to be
<pb facs="tcp:206882:23"/> a great and generall losse; not my losse, or yours, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey's, the Kingdomes, the Churches losse, in which every one of us beareth so great a share, as our Hearts, and Eyes, and Tongues, may well want Sighs, and Teares, and Words to expresse our Grief. All our hope is of another <hi>Phaenix,</hi> that as one Star sets, another will rise, that they which come after her, will inherit her Vertues with her Lands, that so <hi>Camringham</hi> may still be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the Practice and Patronage of Vertue and Religion, for eminent works of Piety and Charity, though she be dead and gone.</p>
               <p>Thus you have seen the coats and garments which our <hi>Dorcas</hi> made, when she was alive: The blessednesse of her life. But a word or two concerning the blessednesse of her death, and I shall conclude.</p>
               <p>There are many of the Saints in the Scripture remarkably blessed in their deaths: I may fitly compare this Gentlewoman to three, esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. She died the death of <hi>Moses:</hi> He died leisurely, God gave him notice of his journy before-hand, for his better preparation, <hi>Go up to the Mount and die:</hi> So departed she from the world, not before she expected death, not before she provided for death: God was pleased in mercy to give her warning, before she flitted, to ring her Passing-bell in her Soule many daies before she died; and whereas many are flattered with hopes of life, till the very
<pb facs="tcp:206882:24"/> hour of death; yet she was upon a meditation of death from the first beginning of her sicknes: Death was not sudden to her, either in respect of expectation, or preparation; she had her Wedding-garment on, and her Lamp trimmed with Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; she was ready for Death, and ripe for Eternity: behold she is coming to the Grave, and she comes as a Shock of corne from the field in due season.<note place="margin">
